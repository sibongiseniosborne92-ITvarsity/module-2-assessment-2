                     <p>Vivien (Bella Thorne) is a high school student who loves numbers. She's studying physics and, in a voiceover, suggests that people are either like atomic particles, or not. TIME IS UP also focuses on two high school swimmers, Steve (Sebastiano Pigazzi), the team's fastest, and tattoo-covered Roy (Benjamin Mascolo), who lives on the wrong side of the tracks. If he can't improve his times, there's no hope of a college scholarship, he's often reminded, and he'll have to work at his dad's garage. Steve and Vivien are a couple, but Steve has been disappearing, not calling or texting when he should. Vivien suspects her mom is having an affair and trails her to find Mom indiscreetly making out with her boyfriend at a local restaurant. Steve is in a relationship with his coach. Roy has seen the pair kissing but keeps the information to himself, which doesn't prevent Steve from threatening Roy. Viviene is not happy confident of her knowledge and does not give her physics test. She is annoyed at Steve that he does not give her time and talk to her.
Vivien learns that Steve is going to Rome for his meet. When she comes home and learns that her parents separated a year ago, distraught, she leaves for Rome to spend time with Steve. Vivien hops on a plane to surprise Steve but ends up spending the day with Roy and walking around Rome. At the end of the day, they end up kissing each other. Embarrassed and distraught, Viviene goes back to her room only to find Steve and his coach together in bed. Shocked and heartbroken, Vivien runs out of the hotel into a dark street, where she's hit by a car. Roy is hot on her trail and runs after her.</p>
